            <h2>Lore</h2>


            <p>In the not-so-distant future, the Great Salt Lake is nothing more than a memory—reduced to a barren
                expanse of toxic dust storms and forgotten history. In its place, an endless sprawl of neon-lit
                corridors, subterranean infrastructure, and gleaming high-rises has risen. The locals call it
                <strong>Salt City</strong>, a name both nostalgic and ironic.</p>

            <p>Built on a hyper-organized grid system, Salt City extends in three dimensions. Addresses now include
                a Z-axis coordinate, marking altitude or depth in the city's labyrinthine layers. You might live at
                <span class="glow">300k West, 200k South, +250 Z</span> or work in the -600 Z depths, where the
                only
                light comes from flickering holo-ads and the glow of terminals.</p>

            <p>The city thrives as a corporate stronghold. The air is thick with particulates from the dried
                lakebed—bad for lungs, but lucrative for Healthcare™. Filtering the air costs credits, and staying
                inside corporate-sanctioned safe zones requires loyalty. Independent districts and runners survive
                by hijacking filtration systems, ducking between abandoned sectors, and exploiting the cracks in the
                grid.</p>

            <p>Salt City may be a corporate dystopia, but the grid is alive with <span class="glitch">runners, rebels, and those who refuse to sell out.</span>
                The question isn’t whether the city will crush them—the question is how long they can run before the
                dust settles.</p>
